# IPS

IPS is a service where you can create a survey and see its statistics. The survey is provided to an interviewee by means of MiniApps [https://dev.miniapps.run] or can be published directly via USSD/SMS or Telegram.

See our wiki [https://docs.miniapps.pro/display/MINIAPPS/How+to+connect+IPS+survey] for how it works.
